# Parking lot — deferred review findings

Review findings that did **not** clear the dev-cycle Convergence guard's
issue-spawning bar (see `.claude/skills/dev-cycle-phases/SKILL.md`). Nothing
here is lost — it is just not allowed to self-schedule. Triage deliberately,
in batches, when a milestone calls for it (e.g. before the develop→main
promotion, or when the git pipeline leaves pre-production and drop-and-resync
stops being an acceptable remedy).

Format: `- [#origin] file/area — one-sentence description (reviewer severity)`

## 2026-08-09 — parked when the #262→#313 loop was closed out

Formerly open issues, closed in favor of this list. Each was real but review-
spawned at chain depth ≥2, remediable by drop-and-resync pre-production, or
made moot if the idempotent-ingestion refactor
(`dev-docs/Idempotent_Git_Ingestion_Design.md`) lands.

- [#310, from #304 review] `src/connectors/git/sync.ts` advisory tiering — self-healing and out-of-window drops rank as permanent losses, and the forward cursor can roll backward (High). Tiering is cosmetic-operator-surface; the cursor-rollback half is obsoleted by idempotent ingestion.
- [#312, from #306 review, SO-3] `src/connectors/git/raw-author-daily.ts` — `invalid_identity` sits on the wrong side of the `ROW_LEVEL_REFUSALS` split, and a truthy non-string author survives the adapter (High). Refusal-accounting taxonomy; grain disappears under idempotent ingestion.
- [#313, from #306 review, SEC-3] `pr_records` grain — a 100% row-level refusal still fails open: `records_skipped` moves but nothing escalates (High). Same class as #306, different grain; fold into the refactor's single write-boundary.

## Backlog (pre-policy deferrals)

- Deferred Medium/Low findings from before this policy live in PR comments
  ("Deferred review findings" on each merged PR) and in
  `reviews/issue-*-multi-pass-*.md`. They stay where they are; do not import
  them here wholesale.
